##Specs

_Example Input: 3_
_Example Output: 3_

_The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel._
_Example Input: i_
_Example Output: iay_

_For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay"._
_Example Input: Whale_
_Example Output: Alewhay_

_If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!_
